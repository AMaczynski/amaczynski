Let me get one thing straight from the start:
All that you'll read here is my own work, based on my own concepts and experiences.

That said.
I do occasionally utilize AI tools (like LLMs) to help with spelling checks, grammar, or suggestions for rewording – the same way that you'd use a spellchecker or have someone else proofread for you. But the content, the ideas, and the structure are mine and mine alone. You won't find auto-generated articles here.

## What can you expect here?

- Technical deep dives from actual projects and experiments.
- Posts about software architecture, code as code, and the art of building software.
- My journey through the world of DDD, TDD, BDD, and other acronyms that sound sexy.
- Lots of Java and JVM (I've worked on Java since the beginning of my career).
- Learning from actual problem-solving.
- Opinions – not always popular or even correct, but always honest and based on my experiences.
- And possibly the occasional nerdy rant or musing about the craft of software building.
- Memes

## What you will not find here
- Auto-generated posts or articles that read like they were written by a machine.
- Clickbait titles or sensationalized posts. (Not sure about that, I have to earn some money to pay my bills too.)
- Material that is not drawn from my own knowledge or experience.

## Why this blog?
I'd like to build my own brand and get a better job—maybe as an architect or consultant? (Do you have a job to offer? Get in touch!)
